        <h3>Chapter 1: The Bunker</h3>
        <p class="left" id="chapter1">
          There was an old bunker deep in the forest that had been abandoned for
          years. Nobody knew exactly why the bunker was built or what was inside
          it. But some claimed that something terrible had happened, something
          that forced people to leave the bunker for good. Despite the many
          warnings, a group of friends decided to explore the bunker.

        <h3>Chapter 2: The Discovery</h3>
        <p class="right" id="chapter2">
          They broke open the old door and stepped inside the bunker. It
          was dark and dusty, and it smelled of mold. They tiptoed through the
          corridors, armed with flashlights and curiosity. As they ventured
          deeper into the bunker, they discovered something that made their
          hearts stop. In a locked room, they found a rusted chest containing a
          strange-looking book.

        <h3>Chapter 3: The Curse</h3>
        <p class="left" id="chapter3">
          One of the friends opened the book, but soon began to shiver. The
          pages were filled with strange symbols and disturbing images. When
          they closed the book, they heard a loud rumble in the distance. One by
          one, they were struck by a curse that kept them trapped inside
          the bunker.

        <h3>Chapter 4: The Trapped Souls</h3>
        <p class="right" id="chapter4">
          The friends were stuck in the bunker, with no way to escape. They
          tried in vain to break open the door, but it was too sturdy. As they
          were trapped in the bunker, they heard creepy sounds and voices coming
          through the walls. They soon realized that they were not alone, and
          that the spirits of past inhabitants of the bunker were wandering
          around.

        <h3>Chapter 5: The End</h3>
        <p class="left" id="chapter5">
          Days passed and they grew weaker and hungrier. They knew they
          couldn't survive in the bunker much longer. One night, however, they
          were jolted awake by a bright light shining through the cracks in the
          door. They screamed for help and tried to push the door open, but it
          was too late. The light disappeared, and they heard a loud rumble
          before everything went silent. The friends were never seen again and
          the bunker was forever sealed, but some claim that their spirits are
          still trapped inside the bunker. </p>
