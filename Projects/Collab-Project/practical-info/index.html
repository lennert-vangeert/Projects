      <h1>Train in Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        Japan is undoubtedly the land of trains, with the famous Shinkansen or
        bullet train. The train and underground line in Tokyo is complicated,
        but it’s without a doubt the best option to move around the city. Trains
        in Japan are clean, efficient and usually punctual, and run very
        regularly on the busiest lines. The downside is that although I said
        they are on time, there are often delays due to accidents with people
        hitting the train or falling onto the tracks, and that at peak times
        they are VERY busy (I think we have all seen images of station staff
        pushing people onto the train). Especially if you are travelling with
        children, it’s not the best option during rush hour.
      </p>
      <h1>Bus in Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        The bus is the least recommended option when it comes to getting around
        Tokyo. The system can be a bit complicate and not very convenient for
        tourists. Also, unlike trains, which usually arrive on time, buses
        depend on traffic conditions and are often delayed. However, if you want
        to travel from Tokyo to other places such as Mt. Fuji or Kyoto and
        Osaka, then the bus is an option to consider. Especially for those who
        want to save money.
      </p>
      <h1>Taxi in Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        Taxis in Japan have a high quality of customer service and efficiency.
        You can find plenty of taxis all over the city, and it’s the most
        comfortable way to get around the city. However, they aren’t a public
        service, and compare with other cities prices are quite high. In
        addition, sometimes there can be problems of understanding with the
        driver due to the language. Recently, with the emergence of taxi apps,
        it also happens that many taxis are already taken and it’s difficult to
        get a free taxi. If you’re not worried about your budget, the best thing
        to do is to hire a private transport by the hour to take you to all the
        places you want to see.
      </p>
      <h1>From the Airports to Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        The first step is to get from the airport to your accommodation in
        Tokyo. And for those who don’t know, Tokyo has two international
        airports: Narita airport and Haneda airport. Narita airport is the most
        used for international flights, but it’s located at least one hour away
        from the centre of Tokyo, in Chiba prefecture. Haneda airport, on the
        other hand, is located in the city of Tokyo itself and is much easier to
        reach. Recently more and more airlines are starting to offer
        international flights from/to Haneda Airport.
      </p>
      <h1>How to get from Narita Airport to Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        To put it simply, the fastest and the best value for money way to get
        from Narita Airport to Tokyo is the Skyliner, a high speed train which
        drops you off in 36 minutes at Nippori Station or Ueno Station in 41
        minutes. The ticket costs 2,570 yen for adults and 1,150 yen for
        children from 6 to 11 years old but in addition to the speed the
        Skyliner also have specific space in each carriage where you can leave
        your suitcases and free Wifi so you can travel comfortably.
      </p>
      <h1>How to get from Haneda Airport to Tokyo</h1>
      <p>
        When it comes to Haneda Airport, the Monorail connecting the airport to
        Hamamatsucho JR station is the most used transportation way. The express
        option connects Haneda Airport and Hamamatsucho in only 13-15 minutes
        (about 20 minutes if you take the local train). The ticket costs 500 yen
        for adults and 250 yen for children. As with Narita Airport, the private
        transfer option is also one of the most common options, especially at
        Haneda Airport as it’s closer to the city centre and therefore cheaper.

      <big>Moving around Tokyo</big>
      <p>
        Once you are in the city centre, the hardest part comes: getting around
        Tokyo! The first thing to keep in mind when we talk about getting around
        in Tokyo is that is a really HUGE city, like, really. Unlike other
        tourist cities that generally have a historical center where most of the
        attractions are located, in Tokyo things are very spread out in the city
        and walk to the places isn’t an option since it may take hours. So you
        need to take train or metro to moving around (they are also bus, but is
        not the most recommend option).
      </p>
      <p>
        And here we have the difficult part about Tokyo: while most cities
        usually have one underground company and one train company, Tokyo has a
        wide range of options. There are several companies and each company has
        different lines. This in itself is confusing, but in addition the price
        of the tickets change according to the distance from one station to
        another, instead of be determinate by zones or areas like in other big
        cities. Usually in the different cities I have been traveling around you
        have a map with area/zone one, two, three, etc. The places under the
        zone one have all the same price, so it’s kind of easy to know how much
        you need to pay using this map.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Tokyo as I said this system doesn’t exist. According to the station
        that you are and the station you wanna go, it would be one price or
        another (if it’s only two stops, one price, if it’s 6 stops, a different
        price, etc). When the city prepared for the Olympic Games, many train
        and metro stations were modernized, but in some stations the names and
        indications that mark the price to the different stations, are only in
        Japanese, so I always remember that during my first trip to Japan it was
        difficult to me know how much money I have to purchase the ticket. And
        let’s face it, it’s neither practical nor functional to have to buy
        individual tickets each time, and since they are small, you may end up
        losing them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can purchase a Tokyo Subway Ticket for 24, 48 or 72 hour and save a
        lot of money, time and hassle. You can move around Tokyo by Tokyo Metro
        and Toei Subway lines as much as you want with the unlimited Tokyo
        Subway Pass.
